## Rene Girard: The Apocalypse of Mimesis

### Backgrounder

#### Rene Girard (1923-2015)

Rene Girard was a French-American literary critic, anthropologist, and philosopher who spent most of his academic career at Stanford University and was elected to the Academie francaise in 2005. He began as a literary scholar, noticing that the great novelists (Cervantes, Stendhal, Flaubert, Dostoevsky, Proust) all converge on the same insight: human desire is not autonomous but imitative. Characters do not spontaneously want things; they want what someone else wants, and the someone else -- the "model" or "mediator" -- is as important to understanding desire as the object itself. From this literary observation, Girard built an increasingly ambitious theory that extends from individual psychology to the origins of human culture, religion, and violence.

Girard's work unfolds in three major phases, each building on the last:

1. **Mimetic desire** (developed in *Deceit, Desire, and the Novel*, 1961): All human desire is mediated -- we learn what to want by imitating others. This is not a pathology but the basic mechanism by which humans acquire language, culture, and identity. However, when two people imitate each other's desires, they inevitably converge on the same objects, producing rivalry. The imitator and the model become "mimetic doubles," locked in escalating competition that neither can escape because each is simultaneously model and imitator for the other.

2. **The scapegoat mechanism** (developed in *Violence and the Sacred*, 1972, and *Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World*, 1978): When mimetic rivalry spreads through a community, it threatens to destroy the social order entirely -- a war of all against all. Archaic societies resolved this crisis through a spontaneous, unconscious mechanism: the violence of all against all converges into the violence of all against one. A single victim -- the scapegoat -- is collectively murdered, and this act of unanimous violence produces a sudden, dramatic restoration of peace. The community, astonished by the transition from chaos to order, concludes that the victim must have been extraordinary -- both the cause of the crisis and the source of its resolution. The murdered scapegoat is thereby divinized: myth is the retelling of the founding murder from the perspective of the persecuting community, which genuinely believes in the guilt of the victim. Religious ritual is the controlled repetition of the founding violence through sacrifice. All human institutions -- kingship, law, religion, even language -- trace back to this originary scene.

3. **The Judeo-Christian revelation** (developed across *Things Hidden* and subsequent works): The Bible is unique among the world's religious texts because it progressively takes the side of the victim rather than the persecuting community. From the story of Cain and Abel, through the Psalms of the innocent sufferer, to the Passion of Christ, the biblical text systematically unveils the innocence of the scapegoat and the lie of sacred violence. The crucifixion is the definitive revelation: an innocent man is killed by a unanimous mob, and the text makes this innocence unmistakable. This revelation is what Girard means by the "things hidden since the foundation of the world" (Matthew 13:35) -- the founding murder that all previous mythologies concealed. Christianity does not introduce a new myth; it destroys the mythical mechanism itself. But this destruction is double-edged: the scapegoat mechanism worked precisely because no one understood it. Once the innocence of the victim is known, sacred violence can no longer restore social order. Modernity -- with its concern for victims' rights, its suspicion of collective violence, its abolition of sacrifice -- is the cultural consequence of this revelation. But modernity has no replacement for the mechanism it has dismantled.

#### Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978)

Girard's most ambitious and systematic work, structured as a dialogue with two psychiatrists (Jean-Michel Oughourlian and Guy Lefort). The title comes from Matthew 13:35: "I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world." Girard reads this as Christ's announcement that the founding murder -- the secret origin of all human culture -- will now be exposed. The book develops the full arc of Girard's theory: from mimetic desire through the scapegoat mechanism to the Christian revelation and its consequences for modernity. It is the primary source for the claims Thiel attributes to Girard in this section.

#### Apocalypse: Original Meaning

The Greek word *apokalypsis* means "unveiling" or "uncovering" -- the removal of a veil that has concealed something. In Girard's usage, the apocalypse is not primarily a future catastrophe but the ongoing process by which the truth of human violence is being revealed. The connection between unveiling and catastrophe is precisely Girard's point: it is the unveiling itself that is catastrophic, because human culture depended on not knowing the truth about its own violent foundations. The apocalypse is dangerous not because God intervenes destructively but because humanity, deprived of its sacrificial safety valve, faces the prospect of unlimited violence with no mechanism for containing it.

#### How This Connects to the Essay's Structure

Girard occupies a unique position in Thiel's essay. Each of the four thinkers examined (Locke, Schmitt, Strauss, Girard) represents a different response to the crisis of modernity, and Thiel presents them in an order of increasing depth and radicalism:

- **Locke** (Section 2) represents the Enlightenment settlement: set aside questions of human nature, build on the "low but solid ground" of rights and commerce. But this framework cannot account for people who refuse its terms.
- **Schmitt** (Section 3) represents the diagnosis of what the Enlightenment suppresses: the friend/enemy distinction and the irreducibility of the political. But his prescription -- re-politicize, fight -- either destroys liberal identity or ends in the Antichrist's comfortable nihilism.
- **Strauss** (Section 4) represents the attempt to recover the permanent questions through philosophical elitism and esoteric writing. But awareness of the city's problematic foundations makes unreflective civic defense impossible.
- **Girard** (Section 5) represents the deepest account of what lies beneath all of these: the founding murder, the scapegoat mechanism, and its progressive unraveling. Girard subsumes and transcends the previous three thinkers. Locke's social contract is the "fundamental lie of the Enlightenment" -- a rationalized version of the founding murder. Schmitt's friend/enemy distinction is a symptom of the mimetic crisis, not its explanation. Strauss's esoteric concealment is a strategy for managing the dangerous truth, but Girard argues that this truth will inevitably become public knowledge.

The essay's conclusion -- the figure of the "Christian statesman" who must side with peace in every close case -- follows directly from Girard's framework. If the scapegoat mechanism is unraveling and cannot be restored, then the only alternative to unlimited violence is a deliberate choice for peace that does not depend on ignorance or myth.

Girard is, by Thiel's own account, the most important thinker in the essay. Thiel studied under Girard at Stanford and has repeatedly identified him as the thinker who most influenced his worldview. The section's placement at the essay's climax -- after Locke, Schmitt, and Strauss have each been examined and found wanting -- signals that Girard provides the framework within which the final conclusion becomes intelligible.

### Summary

Thiel presents Girard as the thinker who goes deepest -- beneath Locke's social contract, beneath Schmitt's friend/enemy distinction, beneath Strauss's philosophical esotericism -- to the hidden foundation of all human culture: the founding murder of the scapegoat. In Girard's account, human desire is fundamentally imitative (mimetic), and because mimetic rivalry has no natural limit in humans, archaic societies survived only through the unconscious mechanism of all-against-one violence, in which a single victim's death restored peace and order. Myth conceals this violence; religion ritualizes it; all political institutions rest upon it. But the Judeo-Christian revelation has progressively unveiled the innocence of the victim and thereby destroyed the mechanism's effectiveness, leaving modernity without any means of containing the violence it has exposed. This creates an apocalyptic situation -- not in the popular sense of future catastrophe, but in the original sense of an unveiling that is itself catastrophic -- in which neither the liberal's faith in human goodness nor the conservative's faith in sacred institutions can prevent the escalation of unbounded mimetic violence. The essay concludes that only a "Christian statesman" who understands both the inevitability of this unveiling and the necessity of choosing peace in every close case can navigate between the twin abysses of runaway mimesis and the false security of archaic violence.

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition | How the author uses it |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| Mimesis / mimetic desire | Girard's foundational concept: human desire is not autonomous or instinctual but imitative. We learn what to want by observing and copying the desires of others. Because desire is mediated through models, it naturally tends toward convergence -- multiple people wanting the same thing -- and therefore toward rivalry. Mimesis is also the mechanism by which all culture is transmitted (language acquisition, social learning), so it cannot be eliminated without eliminating humanity itself. | Thiel presents mimesis as the post-Darwinian key to understanding human nature -- the concept that finally fills Locke's unknowable "X." Human beings are distinguished from other animals not by reason or language per se but by a "greater aptitude for imitation." This insight resolves the Darwin-Aristotle tension by showing both continuity with the animal world (other animals also imitate) and discontinuity (human imitation is qualitatively more powerful, extending into the realm of desire itself). Thiel emphasizes that mimesis is not inherently pathological -- it is what makes us human -- but that its extension into acquisitive desire produces escalating rivalry with no natural brake. |
| The scapegoat mechanism | The process by which archaic communities resolved mimetic crises: when rivalry between mimetic doubles threatened to escalate into unlimited violence (the war of all against all), the community's violence spontaneously converged onto a single victim. The unanimous murder of this victim produced a sudden restoration of peace, and the community, unable to understand its own mechanism, attributed both the crisis and the resolution to the extraordinary power of the victim. | Thiel uses the scapegoat mechanism as Girard's alternative to the social contract. Where Hobbes and Locke imagined rational agents agreeing to form a political society, Girard argues that the actual origin of social order was a collective murder -- irrational, unconscious, and effective precisely because no one understood what was happening. The social contract is thus "the fundamental lie of the Enlightenment": not a contract at all, but a rationalized retelling of the founding murder. This reframing is essential to Thiel's argument because it means the Enlightenment's entire political framework rests on a misunderstanding of its own origins. |
| Founding murder | The original act of scapegoating violence that, in Girard's account, stands at the origin of every human culture, religion, and political institution. It is "remembered and transfigured in myth" but never accurately recalled, because its effectiveness depended on the community's sincere belief in the victim's guilt. | Thiel makes the founding murder the hidden truth that all four thinkers in the essay are, in different ways, grappling with. Locke's social contract conceals it behind rational fiction. Schmitt's friend/enemy distinction perpetuates its logic. Strauss's esotericism protects society from knowing it. Only Girard names it directly. The section's central drama is the question of what happens when this concealment fails -- when the truth of the founding murder becomes general knowledge. |
| Sacred violence vs. desacralized violence | Sacred violence is the controlled, ritualized violence of archaic religion -- sacrifice, ritual combat, judicial execution -- that channels mimetic aggression into contained, socially productive forms by reenacting the founding murder. Desacralized violence is violence stripped of its mythical justification and ritual containment -- violence that serves no ordering function and therefore has no natural limit. | Thiel frames the modern crisis as the passage from sacred to desacralized violence. The Judeo-Christian revelation has progressively delegitimized sacred violence (we no longer believe the scapegoat is guilty), but nothing has replaced it. The result is that "the unraveling of founding myths may deprive humanity of the limited and sacred violence it needed to protect itself from unlimited and desacralized violence." This is the core of the apocalyptic danger: not that violence increases in quantity, but that it loses the cultural mechanisms that once contained it. |
| Apocalypse (original meaning: unveiling) | From the Greek *apokalypsis*, meaning "uncovering" or "revelation." In Girard's usage, the apocalypse is not a future event of divine destruction but the ongoing process by which the truth of human violence -- the innocence of the victim, the lie of sacred violence, the founding murder -- is being progressively revealed. The catastrophic dimension follows from the unveiling itself: if social order depended on concealing the truth of its violent origins, then revealing that truth threatens to dissolve social order. | Thiel uses the Girardian apocalypse to frame the entire post-9/11 situation. The modern world is apocalyptic not because of nuclear weapons per se but because the cultural mechanisms that once contained violence have been dismantled by the very knowledge that makes modernity possible. The "cat is out of the bag": we know the scapegoat is innocent, and we cannot unknow it. Terrorism -- "unbounded, apocalyptic violence" -- is the symptom of a world in which sacred violence no longer functions but unlimited mimetic rivalry persists. |
| The "liberal" and "conservative" (Girard's definitions) | Thiel, drawing on Girard, redefines these terms in relation to knowledge of violence. A "liberal" is someone who "knows nothing of the past and of this history of violence" and retains the Enlightenment belief in natural human goodness. A "conservative" is someone who "knows nothing of the future and of the global world that is destined to be" and still trusts that institutions rooted in sacred violence (the nation-state, traditional religion) can contain human aggression. | Thiel uses these definitions to show that both conventional positions are fatally incomplete. The liberal is blind to the violent origins of human culture and therefore cannot understand or respond to threats that arise from mimetic rivalry. The conservative is blind to the irreversible unraveling of sacred violence and therefore places faith in institutions whose mythical foundations have already been exposed. "The present risks a terrible synthesis of the blind spots" -- violence and globalization with all boundaries abolished. Neither liberal optimism nor conservative nostalgia addresses the actual situation. |
| The Christian statesman | The figure Thiel introduces in the essay's conclusion as the only viable response to the Girardian crisis. The Christian statesman understands, with Girard, that the modern age will not be permanent, that "all will be revealed, all injustices exposed." Unlike Strauss, the Christian statesman does not believe that esoteric concealment can indefinitely manage the dangerous truth. Unlike Schmitt, the Christian statesman does not seek to restore the friend/enemy distinction or revive sacred violence. Unlike the liberal, the Christian statesman does not pretend that violence can be wished away. | Thiel presents the Christian statesman as the essay's final answer -- not a triumphant synthesis but a sober recognition that "in every close case, the wise course is to side with peace." The figure is defined negatively (no return to archaic violence, no accommodation with the Enlightenment, no retreat into biblical study) and positively only in terms of a disposition: siding with peace in close cases. The modesty of this prescription -- cumulative prudential judgment rather than a grand theory -- reflects the depth of the crisis Girard has diagnosed. There is no institutional solution, only a series of individual decisions whose aggregate will determine "the limitless violence of runaway mimesis or the peace of the kingdom of God." |
| "Things hidden since the foundation of the world" | The phrase comes from Matthew 13:35 (quoting Psalm 78:2) and serves as the title of Girard's major work. In context, Jesus says he speaks in parables to reveal "things hidden since the foundation of the world." Girard reads this as Christ's announcement that the founding murder -- the secret on which all human culture rests -- will now be brought to light. | Thiel uses this phrase to name the content of the Girardian revelation: the truth that all human culture originates in collective violence against an innocent victim, and that this truth, once known, cannot be re-concealed. The phrase connects the biblical text to the anthropological theory: what was "hidden" was not a theological abstraction but the concrete historical reality of the scapegoat mechanism. Its revelation is both liberating (it frees us from the lie of sacred violence) and dangerous (it deprives us of the mechanism that contained violence). The double edge of this revelation is the engine of the entire section. |

### Paraphrase Test

**Try this:** Restate the argument of this section in 4-5 sentences of your own. Then compare with the summary above -- what did you capture? What did you miss?

Things to watch for when comparing:

- Did you capture **Girard's alternative to the social contract**? The central move is replacing Hobbes's and Locke's "rational agreement" with the founding murder -- the war of all against all does not end in a contract but in a scapegoat. If you summarized Girard's theory without this specific contrast, you missed the polemical point.

- Did you capture the **double-edged nature of the Christian revelation**? The key Girardian insight is not merely that the scapegoat mechanism exists but that the Bible reveals its injustice, and this revelation is simultaneously a moral advance (we know the victim is innocent) and a civilizational danger (we can no longer use the mechanism to contain violence). If you described the revelation as purely positive or purely negative, you missed the dialectic.

- Did you register **what Girard adds beyond Schmitt and Strauss**? Schmitt diagnosed the persistence of violence; Strauss diagnosed the need for esoteric concealment. Girard explains *why* violence persists (mimetic desire) and *why* concealment is failing (the Judeo-Christian revelation is systematically unveiling the founding murder). If your paraphrase could apply equally to any of the three thinkers, it is not specific enough to Girard.

- Did you capture the **redefinition of "liberal" and "conservative"**? Thiel uses Girard to show that both conventional positions are half-blind -- the liberal to the violent past, the conservative to the irreversible future. This is not a centrist "both sides" argument; it is a claim that neither side understands the depth of the crisis. If you omitted this, you missed one of the section's most striking rhetorical moves.

- Did you capture the **conclusion about the Christian statesman**? The essay does not end with diagnosis but with a (modest) prescription: side with peace in every close case. If your paraphrase ended with the apocalyptic crisis and omitted the response, you missed the essay's resolution -- however tentative it is.

- Did you notice the **temporal argument** between Strauss and Girard? Thiel frames their disagreement as a question of timing: Strauss believes the dangerous truth can remain esoteric indefinitely; Girard believes it will inevitably become public knowledge. This is not a minor point -- it determines whether the Straussian strategy of philosophical elitism is viable or merely a delaying tactic.

### Open Questions

- **Is the founding murder an empirical hypothesis or a structural claim?** Girard presents the scapegoat mechanism as the actual historical origin of human culture, not merely as a useful metaphor or interpretive lens. But what kind of evidence could confirm or disconfirm this? Girard's evidence is primarily textual (myths, rituals, biblical narratives), not archaeological or paleontological. Can a theory about events in deep prehistory -- before writing, before recorded history -- ever be more than a plausible reconstruction? And does the theory's persuasiveness depend on its literal historical truth, or would it retain its explanatory power even as a structural account of how human societies manage violence?

- **Does Girard's framework actually subsume Schmitt and Strauss, or does Thiel's presentation impose a false hierarchy?** Thiel places Girard last and presents him as going deepest, but one could argue that Schmitt's friend/enemy distinction captures something about political life that mimetic theory does not fully explain -- namely, the role of genuine ideological or existential difference, as opposed to mere mimetic convergence. Similarly, Strauss's concern with the tension between philosophy and the city may be irreducible to the question of sacred violence. Does Girard's theory really explain *everything*, or does its comprehensiveness come at the cost of flattening important distinctions?

- **What does Thiel mean by "siding with peace in every close case"?** The prescription is deliberately vague. What counts as a "close case"? Is the decision to go to war in Afghanistan a close case? The decision to invade Iraq? The decision to surveil citizens? The decision to restrict immigration? Without criteria for identifying close cases or for distinguishing them from clear cases, the prescription risks being either vacuous (always choose peace, which is naive) or question-begging (choose peace except when you should not, which says nothing). Is this vagueness a feature -- leaving room for prudential judgment -- or a deficiency?

- **Why does Thiel invoke the "Christian" statesman rather than simply a "Girardian" statesman?** The distinction matters. A Girardian statesman would act on the basis of anthropological knowledge -- understanding mimetic theory and the scapegoat mechanism as social-scientific insights. A Christian statesman acts on the basis of faith -- believing that "the modern age will not be permanent, that all will be revealed." Thiel seems to require the faith dimension, not just the intellectual framework. But why? Is it because the knowledge alone is insufficient to motivate the choice for peace? Because without eschatological hope (the "kingdom of God"), the rational response to the unraveling of sacred violence might be despair or cynicism rather than peacemaking? This question goes to the heart of whether Girard's theory is ultimately a secular anthropology with Christian trappings or a genuinely theological claim that cannot be separated from its religious content.

- **Does the mimetic theory of nuclear proliferation hold up?** Thiel, following Girard, suggests that nations acquire nuclear weapons not only for deterrence or security but for "the mimetic prestige they confer." This is a striking claim. It implies that nuclear proliferation is driven in part by the same mechanism that drives consumer competition -- keeping up with the Joneses, but with warheads. Is there evidence for this? Cases like India and Pakistan, or North Korea, seem to involve a complex mix of security concerns, national prestige, and domestic politics. Does calling the prestige dimension "mimetic" add explanatory power, or is it merely relabeling a familiar phenomenon (status competition among states) in Girardian vocabulary?

- **How does Thiel's Girardian framework relate to his own activities as a technology investor and defense contractor?** Thiel co-founded PayPal (a financial technology company), was an early investor in Facebook (a platform that arguably amplifies mimetic desire to an unprecedented degree), and co-founded Palantir (a surveillance and intelligence company working closely with the U.S. national security apparatus). Each of these enterprises intersects with the Girardian analysis in uncomfortable ways. Facebook makes mimetic rivalry visible and scalable. Palantir operationalizes the state's capacity for violence and surveillance. PayPal extends the Lockean commercial order Girard critiques. Does Thiel see these activities as consistent with the Christian statesman's vocation, or as compromises with a system he knows to be doomed? The essay does not address this tension, but it shadows the text.
