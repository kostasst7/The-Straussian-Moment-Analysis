# Pass 1 -- Comprehension: Section 4 -- Leo Strauss: Proceed with Caution

## Backgrounder

### Leo Strauss (1899-1973)

Leo Strauss was a German-Jewish political philosopher who fled Nazi Germany and eventually settled at the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1949 to 1968. His intellectual project was a recovery of classical political philosophy (Plato, Aristotle, Xenophon, Maimonides, Al-Farabi) against what he saw as the crisis of modernity -- the collapse of the West's confidence in reason, natural right, and the possibility of genuine philosophical knowledge. Strauss argued that modern political philosophy, beginning with Machiavelli and running through Hobbes, Locke, and Nietzsche, had undergone a series of "waves" that progressively lowered the horizon of human aspiration, culminating in relativism and nihilism. His students and intellectual heirs have been controversially associated with American neoconservatism, though the fairness and accuracy of that association remains debated. What is not debated is the difficulty of his prose: Strauss wrote in a deliberately layered manner that demands extraordinary patience from readers, and he insisted that the great thinkers of the past did the same.

### Esoteric vs. Exoteric Writing

This is the core Straussian hermeneutical method. Strauss argued that from antiquity through at least the early modern period, serious philosophers wrote on two levels simultaneously. The **exoteric** surface of their texts conformed to the prevailing orthodoxies of their societies -- religious, political, moral -- and was designed for the general public. The **esoteric** level, embedded "between the lines," contained the philosopher's actual views, which were often heterodox and dangerous. This double writing was not dishonesty but a rational response to the threat of persecution: Socrates was executed, and every subsequent philosopher had reason to remember that fact. The esoteric message was calibrated to be visible only to "trustworthy and intelligent readers" who would ponder the text carefully, notice deliberate contradictions, peculiar examples, and structural anomalies that the casual or hostile reader would miss.

### Persecution and the Art of Writing (1952)

Strauss's key methodological work, in which he lays out the theory of esoteric writing and demonstrates it through readings of Maimonides, Halevi, Spinoza, and others. The book's central claim is that "the influence of persecution on literature is precisely that it compels all writers who hold heterodox views to develop a peculiar technique of writing." Thiel draws heavily on this text throughout Section 4, quoting Strauss's thought experiment of the historian in a totalitarian country and the famous line about the advantages of esoteric communication.

### Natural Right and History (1953)

Strauss's most systematic philosophical work, which attacks modern historicism and value relativism while arguing for the recovery of classical natural right. It opens with a critique of Max Weber's fact-value distinction and proceeds through analyses of natural right in classical, medieval, and modern thought. The book's argument -- that there exists a knowable, permanent truth about human nature and the right way to live -- stands in direct opposition to the Lockean "unknowable X" described in Section 2. Thiel's claim that Strauss "believes that there exists a truth about human nature, and that this truth can in principle be known to humanity" is a compressed reference to this work.

### The Katechon

A theological concept originating in 2 Thessalonians 2:6-7, where Paul refers to a mysterious force "that restraineth" (Greek: *to katechon*) the coming of the Antichrist and the end times. The concept was developed extensively in medieval political theology, where the katechon was often identified with the Roman Empire or the institutional Church -- a worldly power that holds back apocalyptic chaos. Carl Schmitt adopted the concept as a central category of his political theology: the katechon is whatever political order prevents the final dissolution of meaningful political life. Thiel applies the term to Strauss's project: Strauss aims to be the katechon -- to preserve the West by recovering knowledge of the "permanent problems" that the Enlightenment suppressed. The paradox Thiel identifies is that Strauss's very success in uncovering these problems may make it harder to maintain the political order that depends on their concealment. Thus the Straussian project "sets out to preserve the katechon, but instead becomes a 'hastener against its will.'"

### Founding Violence: Romulus and Remus, Cain and Abel

The biblical and Roman founding myths converge on a disturbing pattern: the first city is founded through fratricide. In Genesis 4, Cain murders Abel and then builds the first city (Enoch). In Roman legend, Romulus kills his twin brother Remus and founds Rome. Strauss draws attention to this convergence as evidence that civilizational origins are inseparable from acts of primal violence -- a "permanent problem" that Locke's account of peaceful property acquisition through labor deliberately obscures. Thiel uses this to show that Strauss, unlike Locke, refuses to look away from the dark foundations of political order.

### How This Connects to the Argument

Sections 1 through 3 established a dilemma with no apparent exit. The Enlightenment (Section 1) suppressed questions of human nature, and 9/11 demonstrated that suppression was untenable. Locke (Section 2) grounded liberal rights on the "unknowable X" of human nature, but this framework cannot handle boundary cases -- including an enemy motivated by religious certainty. Schmitt (Section 3) insists that politics (the friend-enemy distinction) is inescapable and the West must fight, but the cost of Schmittian rearmament is the West becoming indistinguishable from its enemy -- a Pyrrhic victory. Section 4 introduces Strauss as the thinker who attempts a middle path: recovering the hard truths about human nature that the Enlightenment suppressed, while avoiding Schmitt's openly violent solutions. Strauss's method is not frontal assault but esoteric discretion -- the "veil" over "sad exigencies." But Thiel ultimately judges even Strauss's path as self-undermining, because self-knowledge about the fragility of political order makes the unreflective defense of that order impossible.

## Summary

Thiel presents Leo Strauss as attempting the central synthesis of the essay: a path between Lockean naivete (which suppresses dangerous truths about human nature) and Schmittian violence (which would destroy the liberal order in the act of defending it). Strauss's key insight is that the great philosophers of the past wrote esoterically -- encoding dangerous but genuine truths "between the lines" for careful readers only -- because certain truths about the nature of the city, the violence of its founding, and the limits of justice in wartime are too destabilizing for open discourse. Against Locke's "unknowable X," Strauss maintains that a permanent truth about human nature exists and can be known, but only through painstaking study, never through systematic summary. However, Thiel argues that the Straussian project is self-undermining: the very act of recovering awareness of the "permanent problems" -- founding violence, the necessity of espionage, the absence of fixed limits on "just reprisals" -- makes the unreflective, unselfconscious defense of liberal democracy impossible. The section concludes by gesturing toward the world of intelligence services and secret action as the practical domain where Straussian insights might be applied, but leaves unresolved whether such a path can actually sustain the liberal order or will instead accelerate its unraveling.

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition | How the author uses it |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| Esoteric / exoteric writing | The practice of writing on two levels: an exoteric surface that conforms to prevailing orthodoxies and is intended for the general public, and an esoteric message "between the lines" that conveys the author's actual, often heterodox, views to careful readers only. | Thiel presents this as Strauss's fundamental method and his central discovery about the great philosophers of the past. Esoteric writing is the mechanism by which dangerous truths about human nature can be preserved across centuries without provoking the persecution of their authors. It also structures Thiel's own essay: Strauss "practices what he preaches," and Thiel is arguably doing the same. |
| The permanent problems | The enduring, irresolvable questions about political life -- the nature of the city and humanity, the violence of founding, the relation between religion and the best regime -- that every serious political thinker must confront but that the Enlightenment attempted to suppress or defer. | Thiel uses this term to define what Strauss recovers from the classical tradition. Unlike Locke, who treats these questions as unanswerable and therefore dismissible, Strauss insists they are permanently present and permanently dangerous. Their recovery is both the strength and the fatal weakness of the Straussian project: knowing the problems makes unreflective political action impossible. |
| The unknowable "X" vs. Strauss's knowable truth | In Section 2, Locke replaced substantive claims about human nature with an unknowable "X" -- a deliberate agnosticism that grounds liberal rights precisely by refusing to define what humans are. Strauss rejects this agnosticism. | Thiel frames Strauss as directly opposing Locke on this point: "Strauss believes that there exists a truth about human nature, and that this truth can in principle be known to humanity." Where Locke's unknowability was a feature (it prevents anyone from imposing a single vision of the good life), Strauss treats it as a catastrophic loss -- the modern relativism and nihilism that leave the West unable to defend itself. The esoteric tradition is evidence that the truth was always known, merely hidden. |
| The katechon / "hastener against its will" | The katechon (from 2 Thessalonians) is the restraining force that holds back apocalyptic dissolution. The "hastener" (*Beschleuniger*) is its opposite: the force that, intentionally or not, accelerates the arrival of the end. | Thiel's most devastating judgment on the Straussian project. Strauss intends to be the katechon -- to fortify the West by recovering knowledge of political realities that Locke suppressed. But the self-awareness this recovery produces paradoxically disables the capacity for unreflective action that the defense of the city requires. The katechon becomes the hastener "against its will." |
| Founding violence (Romulus and Remus / Cain and Abel) | The convergence between the Roman myth of Rome's founding (Romulus murders Remus) and the Genesis account of the first city (Cain murders Abel and builds Enoch): both locate fratricide at the origin of civilization. | Strauss uses this convergence to argue that political founding is inseparable from primal violence -- a truth the American self-understanding (via Thomas Paine's patriotic account of the Revolution) tries to suppress. Thiel follows Strauss in peeling back the patriotic narrative: America "owes her greatness not only to her habitual adherence to the principles of freedom and justice, but also to her occasional deviation from them." Even America, the most liberal regime, has founding violence (the Louisiana Purchase, the fate of Native Americans). |
| "Sad exigencies" / the veil | Strauss's phrase for the morally troubling actions that even decent societies must take in wartime -- including unlimited reprisals and the treatment of "subversive elements within society" -- which he urges should be "left covered with the veil with which they are justly covered." | Thiel uses this to capture Strauss's middle position: unlike Locke, Strauss acknowledges that liberal principles will sometimes be violated out of necessity; unlike Schmitt, he does not celebrate this or build a politics around it. The "veil" is the Straussian answer -- know the truth but do not publicize it. The practical question the essay leaves hanging is whether a veil can hold once you have told everyone it is there. |
| The parallel histories (official history vs. secret services) | The idea, drawn from Roberto Calasso's *The Ruin of Kasch*, that the post-1945 world can be narrated in two irreconcilable ways: the conventional history of states, parties, and public institutions, and the hidden history of intelligence services -- "murders, traps, betrayals, assassinations, cover-ups, and weapons shipments." | Thiel uses this to identify the practical domain where Straussian philosophy finds application. If the overt machinery of liberal democracy (checks and balances, public debate, the United Nations) is insufficient, then the covert world of intelligence -- "Echelon, the secret coordination of the world's intelligence services" -- is where the real work of maintaining global order takes place. This is the Straussian answer to the question of how to act: not through the visible republic, but through the invisible one. |
| "Universally valid hierarchy of ends" vs. "no universally valid rules of action" | Strauss's formulation for his middle position between moral absolutism and moral relativism: there exist permanent, knowable moral ends (the good, justice, the best regime), but the specific actions required to pursue them cannot be fixed in advance and must respond to circumstances, including what the enemy forces upon you. | Thiel highlights this as Strauss's attempt to navigate "between the Scylla of 'absolutism' and the Charybdis of 'relativism.'" It is the philosophical foundation for the "sad exigencies" argument: because the right action depends on context, no limits on wartime conduct "can be defined in advance." This is Strauss's most uncomfortable teaching, and Thiel does not let it pass without noting its implications for civil liberties. |

## Paraphrase Test

**Try this:** Restate the argument of Section 4 in 4-5 sentences of your own, without looking at the summary above. Then compare: Did you capture the impasse that Strauss responds to (Locke too naive, Schmitt too violent)? Did you get the esoteric/exoteric distinction and why it matters? Did you note the self-undermining paradox -- that recovering the permanent problems makes their resolution harder? Did you register the practical turn toward intelligence services and secret action? Did you catch that Thiel ultimately judges Strauss's path, too, as insufficient?

## Open Questions

1. **The self-referential problem of esoteric writing about esoteric writing.** Strauss argues that dangerous truths must be veiled. Thiel is writing an essay that unveils Strauss's method of veiling. Is Thiel's essay itself esoteric -- and if so, what is its esoteric message? Is the very act of publicizing Strauss's method (in a 2007 essay for a general intellectual audience) an example of the "hastening" Thiel warns about?

2. **The gap between "no universally valid rules of action" and political paralysis.** Strauss says the right action in an extreme situation depends on what the enemy forces you to do, and that there are "no assignable limits to what might become just reprisals." But he also says these exigencies should remain veiled. Who, in practice, decides when the veil is lifted? If the answer is the intelligence services (Echelon), what checks exist on their judgment, given that Strauss has just argued that the constitutional machinery of checks and balances produces political paralysis?

3. **Is the American exception real or rhetorical?** Thiel follows Strauss in first presenting America as the possible exception to the rule that great societies require founding violence (via Thomas Paine), and then immediately retracting that exception (the Louisiana Purchase, the fate of Native Americans, "occasional deviation" from principles of freedom and justice). Is Strauss genuinely uncertain, or is this a deliberate esoteric maneuver -- presenting the patriotic account only to undermine it for the careful reader? What does this imply about the American self-understanding that the rest of the essay depends on?

4. **The tension between Strauss and Schmitt on the katechon.** For Schmitt, the katechon is a concrete political-theological actor (the sovereign, the empire, the Church) that restrains chaos through decisive action. For Strauss, the katechon seems to be philosophical knowledge itself -- awareness of the permanent problems. But Thiel argues that Strauss's philosophical katechon inadvertently accelerates what it seeks to prevent. Does this mean that for Thiel, no katechon is possible? If so, the essay's logic drives inexorably toward Girard (Section 5) and the apocalyptic conclusion -- is that the intended direction?

5. **Intelligence services as the "decisive path."** Thiel's suggestion that "Echelon, the secret coordination of the world's intelligence services" represents "the decisive path to a truly global pax Americana" is perhaps the most provocative practical claim in the essay. Is this meant seriously, esoterically, or as a kind of reductio ad absurdum of the Straussian position? If taken at face value, it implies that liberal democracy is a surface phenomenon and that the real governance of the world happens in the shadows -- a claim that most liberal critics would find not just wrong but dangerous. Thiel seems to anticipate this objection ("Liberal critics who disagree with the philosopher also tend to dislike the philosopher's politics") but dismisses it on the ground that "American liberalism is decisively incomplete." Is the incompleteness of liberalism sufficient to justify its wholesale circumvention?

6. **What does Thiel mean by "No new Alexander is in sight"?** The reference to Alexander the Great cutting the Gordian knot implies that the interlocking problems Strauss identifies (intellectual paralysis from self-knowledge, political paralysis from constitutional machinery) could in principle be resolved by a single decisive actor who simply cuts through the contradictions. But Thiel says no such figure exists. Is this a lament, a warning, or a relief? And does the Spengler quotation at the end of the section -- with its invocation of approaching Caesarism and the imperative to "do the necessary or nothing" -- suggest that Thiel thinks such a figure might eventually appear, or that the longing for one is itself part of the problem?
