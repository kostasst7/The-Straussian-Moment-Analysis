# Pass 1 -- Comprehension: Section 2 -- John Locke: The American Compromise

---

## Backgrounder

### John Locke (1632-1704)

John Locke was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as the father of classical liberalism. His political and epistemological writings laid the intellectual foundations for both the American and French revolutions and for the modern liberal democratic tradition more broadly.

Three of Locke's works are central to this section:

- **Two Treatises of Government (1689):** Locke's primary political work, which argues that legitimate government rests on the consent of the governed, that individuals possess natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and that political authority derives from a social contract. The Second Treatise develops his theory of property, arguing that labor is the source of value and that individuals create property by mixing their labor with the raw materials of nature. It is from this text that Thiel draws Locke's claims about self-preservation as the fundamental human desire, the "ill condition" of the state of nature, and the labor theory of value.

- **An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689):** Locke's major epistemological work, which argues that human knowledge is limited to what we can derive from sensory experience. The mind at birth is a *tabula rasa* (blank slate); there are no innate ideas. Crucially for Thiel's argument, Locke contends that we can know only the "secondary qualities" of things -- their observable effects and powers -- not their underlying substances or essences. This epistemological claim becomes, in Thiel's reading, a deliberate demolition of the Aristotelian and Thomistic tradition that grounded political and moral life in claims about human nature.

- **The Reasonableness of Christianity (1695):** A theological work in which Locke argues that Christianity, properly understood, is compatible with reason. Thiel reads this text as an exercise in esoteric writing: Locke ostensibly defends Christianity against atheism, but in the process he redefines Christian teachings so thoroughly -- emphasizing self-preservation over love of God, loosening the obligations of marriage and filial piety, legitimating the accumulation of wealth -- that the Christianity that emerges is virtually indistinguishable from secular liberalism.

### The American Founding and Locke

The connection between Locke and the American founding is one of the most extensively debated topics in American intellectual history. The Declaration of Independence (1776) echoes Lockean language directly: "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" parallels Locke's "life, liberty, and property" (the substitution of "happiness" for "property" is itself significant). The Constitution's framework of limited government, separation of powers, and protection of individual rights reflects Lockean principles about the purpose and constraints of political authority.

Thiel goes further than most historians, calling Locke the "definitive founder" of the United States -- not merely an influence on the founders but the architect of the conceptual framework within which America was conceived. This is a deliberately provocative claim. It means that America is, at its core, a Lockean experiment: a nation built on the premise that questions about human nature and the good life should be set aside in favor of individual rights, commerce, and the protection of property. The success of that experiment, Thiel suggests, is precisely what made Americans forget the radicalism of the original premise.

### Hobbes vs. Locke

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) and John Locke are often paired as the two foundational thinkers of modern liberal political philosophy, though they differ on crucial points:

- **What they share:** Both reject the older Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition that grounded politics in claims about human nature, virtue, and the good life. Both begin from a hypothetical "state of nature" and argue that rational self-interest drives individuals to form political societies. Both treat self-preservation rather than virtue as the fundamental political concern.

- **Where they differ:** For Hobbes, the state of nature is a "war of all against all," and the only escape is to surrender nearly all individual freedom to an absolute sovereign (Leviathan). For Locke, the state of nature is less dire -- individuals possess natural rights even before government exists -- and the social contract preserves rather than eliminates those rights. Government exists to protect pre-existing rights, not to create order from chaos.

In this section, Thiel treats them as part of the same project. Hobbes reduces all human motivation to the desire for power; Locke elaborates this reduction by stripping human attributes of anything specifically human -- will, liberty, and understanding become mere "powers," and the underlying substance that possesses them becomes unknowable. The difference is one of temperament and strategy, not of fundamental direction: Hobbes is blunt, Locke is cautious, but both are dismantling the older tradition's claims about what human beings are.

### Key Concepts

- **State of nature:** A hypothetical condition of human life before the establishment of government or political society. Both Hobbes and Locke use it as a thought experiment to justify the social contract, but they describe it very differently. Thiel emphasizes Locke's characterization of it as an "ill condition" where people are "needy and wretched" -- a description that serves the argumentative purpose of making the state of nature worthless, so that nearly all value can be attributed to human labor rather than to natural endowment.

- **Social contract:** The theoretical agreement by which individuals consent to form a political society and accept certain constraints on their freedom in exchange for the protection of their remaining rights. In Locke's version, the contract is limited: government exists to protect life, liberty, and property, and citizens retain the right to revolt if government exceeds its mandate.

- **Natural rights:** Rights that individuals possess by virtue of their humanity, prior to and independent of any government. In Locke's framework, these include the right to life, liberty, and property. Thiel argues that Locke derives these rights not from a positive account of human nature (as in the Aristotelian tradition) but from the *impossibility* of knowing human nature -- a crucial distinction.

- **Property rights and the labor theory of value:** Locke argues that individuals create property by mixing their labor with natural resources. Since "labor makes the far greatest part of the value of things we enjoy in this world," the original state of nature contributes very little. This claim has a political function beyond economics: if nature is nearly worthless, then questions about the justice of original appropriation become unimportant, and the focus can shift to protecting property rights going forward.

- **The unknowable "X":** Thiel's term (drawing on Locke's epistemology) for the radical agnosticism about human nature that undergirds the Lockean-American political framework. Since we cannot know the true substance or essence of human beings -- only their observable "powers" and effects -- we have no basis for telling people what they should want or how they should live. This unknowability becomes the philosophical foundation for liberal rights: freedom of religion, speech, property, and commerce all follow from the premise that no one is in an authoritative position to challenge another person's desires.

### Connection to Section 1

Section 1 established the problem: the Enlightenment deliberately abandoned questions about human nature after the devastation of the religious wars, substituting economic rationality and institutional design. The 9/11 attacks exposed the limits of this substitution by producing adversaries -- wealthy, educated, religiously motivated -- whom the framework could not explain or deter.

Section 2 is the first of four thinker-specific examinations that structure the rest of the essay. Locke represents the Enlightenment's positive answer to the crisis described in Section 1: here is how the West actually built its post-religious-war order, and here is what that order looks like when examined closely. Thiel's treatment of Locke is not a simple rejection; he presents Locke's achievement as genuinely impressive and historically consequential. But he also exposes its internal limitations -- the "boundary cases" that the Lockean framework defers or dismisses -- and argues that 9/11 and the oil economy represent precisely the kind of cases that cannot be deferred any longer. The section thus functions as both an appreciation and a critique: Locke solved the problem of religious war within the West, but his solution depended on assumptions (that nature is nearly valueless, that all people will eventually become homo economicus, that the non-Western world can be ignored) that have now broken down.

## Summary

Thiel argues that John Locke constructed the intellectual framework for American liberal democracy by pursuing a deliberate rhetorical strategy: rather than openly attacking Christianity or the older philosophical tradition, Locke quietly redefined their core concepts until they became compatible with -- and ultimately indistinguishable from -- secular capitalism. At the epistemological level, Locke replaced the Aristotelian claim that we can know human nature with the claim that human nature is unknowable (the "X"), and from this agnosticism he paradoxically derived the strong liberal rights to religion, speech, and property. This framework proved enormously successful: the United States became the world's dominant power, and its citizens forgot how radical and strange the founding premises were. But the framework depended on deferring certain "boundary cases" -- questions about the justice of original property acquisition, about people who do not behave as rational economic actors, and about the non-Western world where the Enlightenment's bargain never took hold. September 11 forced these deferred questions back into view, as bin Laden's religiously motivated violence, funded by oil wealth that refutes Locke's labor theory of value, demonstrated that the Lockean compromise cannot account for a world where not everyone has accepted its terms.

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition | How the author uses it |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| The unknowable "X" | Locke's epistemological conclusion that the true substance or essence of human beings cannot be known -- we can observe only their "powers" and secondary effects, never their underlying nature. | Thiel argues that this agnosticism, far from being a modest philosophical concession, is the foundational move of the entire American political order. Because no one can claim authoritative knowledge of what humans are, no one can legitimately tell others what to want, believe, or do. Liberal rights (religion, speech, property) are derived not from a positive account of human dignity but from the impossibility of such an account. The "X" is the "low but solid ground" on which the American founding takes place. |
| Esoteric writing (as applied to Locke) | The practice of concealing one's true meaning beneath an outward show of orthodoxy -- writing for two audiences simultaneously, with the surface meaning reassuring conventional readers while the deeper meaning is legible only to careful, philosophically initiated readers. | Thiel reads Locke as a master of esoteric writing. In *The Reasonableness of Christianity*, Locke ostensibly defends Christianity against atheism, but his "defense" systematically redefines Christian teachings until they support self-preservation, property rights, and wealth accumulation. Thiel draws an explicit parallel between Locke's strategy and the strategy Locke attributes to Christ himself: both conceal their true message to avoid persecution and to achieve their goals gradually. The implication is that Locke was far more radical than he appeared, and that the gradual secularization of America was not an unintended drift but was built into the original design. |
| The state of nature | A hypothetical pre-political condition in which human beings live without government, laws, or organized society. In the older natural-law tradition, nature was understood as ordered, purposeful, and valuable; in Locke's version, it is an "ill condition" of neediness and wretchedness. | Thiel emphasizes Locke's demotion of the state of nature as performing crucial argumentative work: if the state of nature is nearly worthless, then almost all value must come from human labor and intellect, which justifies strong property rights and makes questions about the justice of original appropriation ("how did you get this land in the first place?") largely irrelevant. This move also sets up Thiel's later critique via the oil industry, where enormous value exists "simply in nature," contradicting Locke's premise. |
| Boundary cases | Situations or categories of persons that fall outside the neat logic of a theoretical framework and expose its limitations -- the hard exceptions that a system must either resolve or defer. In Locke's framework, these include: the rights of children, criminals, and the insane; the limits of commodification; the justice of original property acquisition; and the existence of people who are not rational economic actors. | Thiel argues that Locke's strategy was to acknowledge these cases but defer them as exceptional, trusting that the general principle of expanding liberty would handle them over time. The section's climax is the argument that September 11 represents a boundary case that can no longer be deferred: bin Laden is a wealthy, powerful man motivated by religious conviction rather than economic rationality, funded by oil wealth that contradicts the labor theory of value. The "boundaries" Locke dismissed have become the central problem. |
| The Lockean/American compromise | The implicit bargain at the heart of American liberal democracy: dangerous questions about human nature, religion, virtue, and the good life are set aside in exchange for individual rights, commercial prosperity, and civil peace. The compromise works by treating these questions as unanswerable (the "X") rather than answering them incorrectly. | Thiel presents this compromise as genuinely successful for over two centuries -- it avoided the catastrophic anti-religious violence of the French and Russian revolutions while still achieving thoroughgoing secularization. But the compromise was always conditional on certain assumptions: that nature is nearly valueless (so property questions can be forward-looking), that all people will eventually adopt economic rationality, and that the non-Western world can be left out of the picture. September 11 broke these conditions. |
| The oil exception | The fact that petroleum wealth represents a massive counter-example to Locke's labor theory of value: most of the value of oil exists "simply in nature," with human labor adding only a proportionately small amount through extraction and refining. | Thiel uses the oil industry as a concrete demonstration that Locke's framework breaks down precisely where it matters most. If value comes primarily from labor, then unjust original acquisition fades into insignificance as new, legitimately earned wealth dwarfs it. But oil reverses this logic: its value is overwhelmingly natural, its appropriation was largely a story of "crime on a scale so grand," and the fortunes it built (including bin Laden's) represent exactly the kind of concentrated, unjustly acquired power that Locke's theory dismisses. The oil exception is not peripheral; it is the material foundation of the geopolitical crisis Thiel is analyzing. |

## Paraphrase Test

**Try this:** Restate the argument of this section in 3-4 sentences of your own. Then compare with the summary above -- what did you capture? What did you miss?

Key points to check your paraphrase against:

- Did you capture Locke's *method* -- the esoteric, gradualist strategy of redefining tradition from within rather than attacking it openly?
- Did you capture the philosophical core -- the move from "human nature is knowable" to "human nature is unknowable," and the derivation of liberal rights from that agnosticism?
- Did you capture the relationship between the labor theory of value and the dismissal of boundary cases about original property acquisition?
- Did you capture the turn at the end of the section -- the argument that September 11 and the oil economy represent boundary cases that can no longer be deferred?
- Did you capture the irony Thiel identifies: that America's gradual secularization was not a betrayal of its founding but a fulfillment of it?

## Open Questions

- **Is Thiel's reading of Locke as an esoteric writer historically defensible, or is it an imposition of Leo Strauss's hermeneutic method onto a thinker who may have been more straightforwardly sincere?** Thiel presents Locke's apparent defense of Christianity as a deliberate disguise for a secularizing agenda, but many historians of philosophy read Locke as a genuinely devout (if heterodox) Christian. This question becomes especially important because Thiel's entire argument about the "original conception" of American secularization depends on it. If Locke was sincere, then America's drift from Christianity really is a drift, not a design -- and the conservative moralists Thiel gently mocks may have a point.

- **Does the "unknowable X" argument actually work as a foundation for liberal rights, or does it prove too much?** Thiel presents it as a "low but solid ground," but one might object that genuine agnosticism about human nature could equally justify authoritarianism (if we do not know what humans are, perhaps we should err on the side of control rather than freedom) or nihilism (if we cannot know human nature, perhaps rights are just conventions with no philosophical grounding at all). Thiel seems aware of this problem -- he calls the ground "low" -- but does not fully address it.

- **How much weight can the oil exception bear?** Thiel treats the oil industry as a decisive refutation of Locke's labor theory of value, but one could argue that oil is an anomaly rather than a paradigm -- that in the vast majority of cases, human labor and intellect really do account for most value creation. If the oil exception is just one industry among many, does it really undermine the Lockean framework, or is it simply a hard case that the framework handles imperfectly?

- **What does Thiel mean by calling the Enlightenment a "period of intellectual slumber and amnesia"?** The final sentence of the section is one of its most striking: Thiel describes the entire Enlightenment as "misleadingly called" -- implying that what presented itself as an awakening of reason was actually a forgetting of important truths. But what truths, specifically? The older tradition's claims about human nature? The reality of religious motivation? The danger of boundary cases? This question connects to the essay's larger trajectory: Thiel is building toward alternative frameworks (Schmitt, Strauss, Girard) that recover what the Enlightenment suppressed.

- **Is Thiel conflating Locke's philosophical project with America's actual historical development?** The section moves seamlessly from Locke's texts to American political culture to the 1990s to September 11, as if these were all one continuous Lockean experiment. But American history involved many thinkers, traditions, and contingencies beyond Locke -- republican virtue theory, Puritan theology, Jeffersonian agrarianism, the Civil War, the Progressive Era, and so on. Does treating America as simply "the country founded by Locke" flatten a more complex intellectual history? This simplification may be deliberate (Thiel is writing an essay, not a monograph), but it is worth flagging as an assumption that shapes the entire argument.

- **What is the status of the Keynes allusion in the final paragraphs?** When Thiel writes "none of this will matter if we are all dead in the short run," he is inverting Keynes's famous remark that "in the long run we are all dead." Keynes used the phrase to argue against excessive faith in long-run economic equilibrium; Thiel repurposes it to argue against excessive faith in the long-run triumph of liberal capitalism over religious fanaticism. The allusion is worth tracking because it suggests Thiel sees the problem as one of temporal horizons: Locke's framework may be correct in the long run but fatally inadequate in the short run, which is the only run that matters if existential threats are at stake.
