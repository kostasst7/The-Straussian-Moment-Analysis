# Pass 1 — Comprehension: The Straussian Moment

## Section 1: Introduction / The Question of Human Nature

### Backgrounder

#### The Enlightenment Project

The Enlightenment (roughly 18th century onward) was the broad intellectual movement that placed human reason, scientific inquiry, and individual liberty at the center of political and moral life. Its core assumptions about human nature include: (1) that people are fundamentally rational agents who respond to incentives; (2) that economic motivation is the primary driver of human behavior, making material prosperity the key to social stability; and (3) that history moves in a direction of progress, where better institutions, more commerce, and wider education will gradually pacify humanity. Under this framework, political philosophy could safely set aside questions about virtue, the soul, or the meaning of life and instead focus on institutional design, property rights, and the management of competing interests.

#### Athens vs. Jerusalem

Before the Enlightenment, the Western tradition drew on two deep and fundamentally incompatible sources:

- **Athens (classical philosophy):** Represented by thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, and later Machiavelli, this tradition emphasizes reason, civic virtue, and the life of the polis. The highest human achievement is the exercise of practical and theoretical wisdom. Political life demands courage, honor, and sometimes sacrifice; the good life is discovered through philosophy and enacted through citizenship.

- **Jerusalem (Christian theology):** Represented by the biblical tradition and thinkers like Augustine, this stream emphasizes faith, sin, grace, and salvation. The world is fallen; human beings are marked by original sin and cannot perfect themselves through reason alone. True fulfillment lies not in political achievement but in obedience to God; earthly kingdoms are, at best, tolerable arrangements in a vale of tears.

The tension is structural. The citizen of Athens asks: how do I live nobly and serve the city? The Christian of Jerusalem asks: how do I live faithfully and serve God? Each regards the other's sacrifices as vain. For the citizen, Christian mortification is a waste of energy that should go toward political and military excellence. For the Christian, the citizen's worldly ambitions are dust compared to eternal salvation.

#### Key Thinkers Referenced

- **Voltaire / Candide:** Voltaire (1694-1778) was a leading French Enlightenment writer and satirist. His novella *Candide* (1759) mocks philosophical optimism; the protagonist concludes that the wisest course is simply to "cultivate one's garden" -- a metaphor for modest, private contentment rather than grand ambitions.

- **Augustine (354-430):** The most influential theologian in Western Christianity. His *City of God* argues that earthly political orders are deeply flawed and that true peace belongs only to the heavenly city; human beings are fallen creatures prone to sin, and political life must reckon with this darkness.

- **Machiavelli (1469-1527):** Florentine political philosopher who broke with the classical-Christian synthesis by describing politics as it actually is rather than as it ought to be. He acknowledged human capacity for evil and argued that effective rulers must sometimes use force and deception -- a pagan realism about human danger.

- **Adam Smith (1723-1790):** Scottish philosopher and author of *The Wealth of Nations* (1776), the founding text of classical economics. He argued that self-interested economic activity, guided by markets, produces general prosperity -- placing economic rationality at the heart of political order.

- **Karl Marx (1818-1883):** German philosopher and author of *Das Kapital*. He agreed with Smith that economic forces drive history but argued that capitalism produces class conflict that will culminate in revolution. Despite their opposition, both Smith and Marx treat human beings as primarily economic actors.

- **Hegel (1770-1831):** German idealist philosopher who saw history as the progressive unfolding of reason and freedom, culminating in the rational state. He synthesized elements of both Athens and Jerusalem into a theory of historical progress.

- **Kant (1724-1804):** German philosopher who grounded morality in pure reason and envisioned perpetual peace through a federation of republican states. He represents the Enlightenment faith that rational principles can resolve political conflict without recourse to religious or traditional authority.

- **Hobbes (1588-1679):** English philosopher and author of *Leviathan*. Thiel identifies him as "the first truly modern philosopher" because he explicitly abandoned questions of virtue and the good life in favor of a single overriding concern: the avoidance of violent death. Hobbes argued that rational self-preservation, not honor or faith, should be the basis of political order.

- **Pierre Manent (b. 1949):** Contemporary French political philosopher. His book *The City of Man* traces how the mutual exhaustion of the classical and Christian traditions gave rise to the modern individual -- someone who defines himself by rejecting all forms of sacrifice.

#### The Early Modern Crisis

The tension between Athens and Jerusalem did not remain theoretical. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Reformation shattered the institutional unity of Western Christianity. Martin Luther's challenge to the Catholic Church produced not peaceful reform but escalating violence, as Protestants and Catholics each tried to impose their vision of the true faith by force. The Counter-Reformation intensified the conflict. This escalation culminated in the **Thirty Years' War (1618-1648)**, fought primarily across the German lands, which by some estimates killed over half the population of Germany. It was one of the most devastating conflicts in European history.

The **Peace of Westphalia (1648)** ended the war by effectively agreeing to disagree: each sovereign would determine the religion of his own territory. This settlement is the founding moment of the modern state system. Its deeper consequence was that questions of virtue, the good life, and true religion were gradually pushed out of public life and into the private sphere. Polite, respectable people learned not to discuss them, because such discussions had led to catastrophic bloodshed. This is the political origin of the Enlightenment's "strategic retreat" from questions of human nature.

#### How This Sets Up the Essay

Thiel's argument is that September 11, 2001 shattered the Enlightenment framework by producing an adversary it could not explain. The 9/11 attackers were not the economically desperate masses that Marxist or liberal development theory predicted would turn to violence. They were affluent, educated, religiously motivated men who sought glory and martyrdom -- precisely the kind of human motivation that modern political thought had declared irrelevant or irrational. If economic incentives cannot contain violence, and if rational deterrence does not work against suicidal actors, then the Enlightenment's bargain -- safety in exchange for not asking dangerous questions about human nature -- has broken down. The rest of the essay asks what happens when those suppressed questions return, examining the problem through four thinkers: Locke, Schmitt, Strauss, and Girard.

### Summary

Thiel argues that the September 11 attacks exposed a fundamental failure in modern Western political thought. The Enlightenment had deliberately abandoned questions about human nature, virtue, and religion -- questions that once animated both classical philosophy and Christian theology -- because debating them had led to catastrophic violence (above all the Thirty Years' War). In their place, modernity substituted a framework built on economic rationality, material incentives, and institutional design. But the 9/11 attackers -- wealthy, educated, religiously motivated -- could not be explained or deterred by this framework. Their existence demonstrates that not all human beings are *homo economicus*, and that the political thought stretching from Smith through Marx to Kant and Hegel requires fundamental reexamination.

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition | How the author uses it |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| *homo economicus* | The model of human beings as fundamentally rational, self-interested economic actors who respond predictably to material incentives. | Thiel argues this model is the shared assumption of both left and right in modern politics (Smith and Marx alike), and that 9/11 proved it incomplete: the attackers were wealthy and educated, motivated by religious glory rather than economic grievance. |
| Athens and Jerusalem | Shorthand for the two pre-modern Western traditions: classical Greek philosophy (reason, civic virtue, the polis) and biblical/Christian theology (faith, sin, salvation). | Thiel follows Manent in arguing that these two traditions, though fundamentally incompatible, jointly sustained a richer account of human nature. Their mutual exhaustion through centuries of conflict gave rise to the modern individual and the Enlightenment retreat from questions of virtue. |
| The modern individual | In Manent's formulation, the person who defines him- or herself by rejecting all forms of sacrifice -- the product of the mutual discrediting of both Athens and Jerusalem. | Thiel uses this concept to explain why modernity lacks the intellectual resources to comprehend actors who embrace sacrifice and martyrdom. The modern individual, having rejected the frameworks that made sense of such commitments, literally cannot account for them. |
| The Enlightenment's "strategic retreat" | The deliberate decision by Enlightenment thinkers to abandon questions about human nature, virtue, and the good life because debating them had proved too dangerous and deadly. | Thiel treats this retreat not as intellectual progress but as a pragmatic bargain: safety was purchased at the cost of understanding. September 11 revealed the price of that bargain -- a civilization unable to comprehend or counter adversaries motivated by pre-modern commitments. |
| The Peace of Westphalia | The 1648 treaties that ended the Thirty Years' War by establishing the principle that each sovereign determines the religion of his own territory, effectively removing religious questions from interstate politics. | Thiel identifies 1648 as "the single year that dates the birth of the modern era," the moment when the West formalized its decision to treat questions of virtue and religion as private matters. This is the institutional origin of the Enlightenment project. |
| *ex ante* / *ex post* | Latin terms meaning "before the fact" and "after the fact," used to distinguish between how reasonable a decision appeared at the time versus how it looks in retrospect. | Thiel concedes that wealth transfers to the developing world made sense *ex ante* (preventing communist revolution seemed urgent in the late 1940s), but argues they look naive *ex post* -- the actual threat came not from the economically desperate but from the affluent and religiously motivated. |
| *Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori* | Latin phrase from Horace meaning "It is sweet and fitting to die for one's country." Wilfred Owen later called it "the old lie" in his World War I poem. | Thiel uses the phrase to mark the transition from the older tradition (which honored sacrificial death for city or faith) to modernity (which regards such death as meaningless). Hobbes's boast of deserting a religious war epitomizes the modern reversal: a cowardly life became preferable to a heroic but purposeless death. |
| The wealth transfer consensus | The post-WWII policy of channeling hundreds of billions of dollars from developed to developing nations through institutions like the World Bank and IMF, on the theory that economic development would prevent revolutionary violence. | Thiel argues this consensus rested on the *homo economicus* assumption -- that poverty causes violence and prosperity prevents it. The 9/11 attackers' affluence refuted the theory at its root: violence can spring from religious and ideological motives that no amount of economic development addresses. |

### Paraphrase Test

**Try this:** Restate the argument of this section in 3-4 sentences of your own. Then compare with the summary above -- what did you capture? What did you miss?

### Open Questions

- Is Thiel right that 9/11 fundamentally challenged modern political thought, or is he overstating the case? Could the Enlightenment framework accommodate religiously motivated terrorism as an anomaly rather than a refutation?
- What exactly does the "older tradition" offer that modernity abandoned -- and can it be recovered without also recovering the violence (Reformation wars, inquisitions) that accompanied it?
- How will each of the four thinkers Thiel examines next (Locke, Schmitt, Strauss, Girard) respond to this problem? What does it mean that he has chosen two liberals and two anti-liberals?
- Why does Thiel choose the bin Laden example specifically -- what argumentative work does it do? Is the comparison to the Rockefellers rhetorical provocation or a genuine analytical point?
- Thiel frames the Enlightenment retreat as a response to the Thirty Years' War, but is this historically accurate or a simplification? Did Hobbes, Locke, and others really abandon questions of human nature, or did they reformulate them?
- The section implies that technology (which enables small groups to inflict mass casualties) has changed the political calculus permanently. How does this technological claim interact with the philosophical argument about human nature? Are these two separate problems or one?

## Section 2: John Locke: The American Compromise

### Backgrounder

#### John Locke (1632-1704)

John Locke was an English philosopher and physician, widely regarded as the father of classical liberalism. Three of his works are central to this section:

- **Two Treatises of Government (1689):** Argues that legitimate government rests on the consent of the governed, that individuals possess natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and that political authority derives from a social contract. The Second Treatise develops his theory of property, arguing that labor is the source of value and that individuals create property by mixing their labor with the raw materials of nature.

- **An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689):** Argues that human knowledge is limited to what we can derive from sensory experience. We can know only the "secondary qualities" of things -- their observable effects and powers -- not their underlying substances or essences. In Thiel's reading, this epistemological claim is a deliberate demolition of the Aristotelian and Thomistic tradition that grounded political and moral life in claims about human nature.

- **The Reasonableness of Christianity (1695):** Ostensibly defends Christianity against atheism, but Thiel reads it as an exercise in esoteric writing: Locke redefines Christian teachings so thoroughly -- emphasizing self-preservation over love of God, loosening the obligations of marriage and filial piety, legitimating the accumulation of wealth -- that the Christianity that emerges is virtually indistinguishable from secular liberalism.

#### The American Founding and Locke

Thiel calls Locke the "definitive founder" of the United States -- not merely an influence on the founders but the architect of the conceptual framework within which America was conceived. The Declaration of Independence echoes Lockean language directly ("life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"), and the Constitution's framework of limited government and individual rights reflects Lockean principles. Thiel's provocative claim is that America is a Lockean experiment, and that the success of this experiment caused Americans to forget how radical the founding premises were.

#### Hobbes vs. Locke

Both Hobbes and Locke reject the older Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition and begin from a hypothetical "state of nature," arguing that rational self-interest drives individuals to form political societies. They differ on severity: Hobbes requires an absolute sovereign; Locke preserves individual rights. But in this section, Thiel treats them as part of the same project. Hobbes reduces all human motivation to the desire for power; Locke elaborates this reduction by stripping human attributes of anything specifically human -- will, liberty, and understanding become mere "powers," and the underlying substance that possesses them becomes unknowable.

#### Key Concepts

- **State of nature:** Locke's hypothetical pre-political condition, described as an "ill condition" of neediness and wretchedness. If the state of nature is nearly worthless, then almost all value comes from human labor, which justifies strong property rights and makes questions about original appropriation largely irrelevant.

- **Natural rights:** Rights that individuals possess prior to government. In Locke's framework: life, liberty, and property. Thiel argues these derive not from a positive account of human nature but from the *impossibility* of knowing human nature.

- **The unknowable "X":** Thiel's term for Locke's radical agnosticism about human essence. Because we cannot know what human beings truly are, we have no basis for telling them what to want or how to live -- and from this agnosticism, liberal rights paradoxically follow.

#### How This Section Connects to Section 1

Section 1 established the problem: the Enlightenment abandoned questions about human nature after the religious wars, substituting economic rationality. September 11 exposed this substitution's limits. Section 2 is the first of four thinker-specific examinations. Locke represents the Enlightenment's positive answer to the crisis described in Section 1 -- how the West actually built its post-religious-war order. Thiel treats Locke's achievement as genuinely impressive but exposes its internal limitations: the "boundary cases" (unjust property origins, religious actors, the non-Western world) that the Lockean framework defers or dismisses, and that 9/11 forced back into view.

### Summary

Thiel argues that John Locke constructed the intellectual framework for American liberal democracy by pursuing a deliberate rhetorical strategy: rather than openly attacking Christianity or the older philosophical tradition, Locke quietly redefined their core concepts until they became compatible with secular capitalism. At the epistemological level, Locke replaced the Aristotelian claim that we can know human nature with the claim that human nature is unknowable (the "X"), and from this agnosticism he paradoxically derived the strong liberal rights to religion, speech, and property. This framework proved enormously successful, but it depended on deferring certain "boundary cases" -- the justice of original property acquisition, people who reject economic rationality, the non-Western world. September 11 forced these deferred questions back into view, as bin Laden's religiously motivated violence, funded by oil wealth that refutes Locke's labor theory of value, demonstrated that the Lockean compromise cannot account for a world where not everyone has accepted its terms.

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition | How the author uses it |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| The unknowable "X" | Locke's epistemological conclusion that the true substance or essence of human beings cannot be known -- we observe only their "powers" and secondary effects, never their underlying nature. | Thiel argues this agnosticism is the foundational move of the entire American political order. Because no one can claim authoritative knowledge of what humans are, no one can legitimately tell others what to want, believe, or do. Liberal rights are derived not from a positive account of human dignity but from the impossibility of such an account -- the "low but solid ground" on which the American founding takes place. |
| Esoteric writing (as applied to Locke) | The practice of concealing one's true meaning beneath an outward show of orthodoxy, writing for two audiences simultaneously -- the surface meaning reassures conventional readers while the deeper meaning is legible only to careful readers. | Thiel reads Locke as a master of esoteric writing. In *The Reasonableness of Christianity*, Locke ostensibly defends Christianity but systematically redefines it to support self-preservation, property rights, and wealth accumulation. Thiel draws a parallel between Locke's strategy and the strategy Locke attributes to Christ: both conceal their true message to achieve their goals gradually. The implication is that America's gradual secularization was not drift but design. |
| The state of nature | A hypothetical pre-political condition; in Locke's version, an "ill condition" where people are "needy and wretched," with very little natural value. | Thiel emphasizes Locke's demotion of the state of nature as performing crucial argumentative work: if nature is nearly worthless, almost all value comes from human labor, which justifies strong property rights and makes questions about original appropriation irrelevant. This sets up Thiel's critique via the oil industry, where enormous value exists "simply in nature," contradicting Locke's premise. |
| Boundary cases | Situations or persons that fall outside the neat logic of a theoretical framework and expose its limitations -- children, criminals, the insane, commodification limits, unjust property origins, non-economic actors. | Thiel argues that Locke acknowledged these cases but deferred them, trusting that expanding liberty would handle them over time. The section's climax is the argument that 9/11 represents a boundary case that can no longer be deferred: bin Laden is wealthy, powerful, and motivated by religion, not economics, funded by oil wealth that contradicts the labor theory of value. |
| The Lockean/American compromise | The implicit bargain at the heart of American liberal democracy: dangerous questions about human nature, religion, and virtue are set aside in exchange for individual rights, commercial prosperity, and civil peace. | Thiel presents this compromise as genuinely successful for over two centuries -- avoiding the anti-religious catastrophes of France and Russia while achieving thorough secularization. But it was conditional on assumptions now broken: that nature is valueless, that all people will adopt economic rationality, and that the non-Western world can be ignored. |
| The oil exception | The fact that petroleum wealth contradicts Locke's labor theory of value: most of the value of oil exists "simply in nature," with human labor adding proportionately little through extraction and refining. | Thiel uses the oil industry as a concrete demonstration that Locke's framework breaks down precisely where it matters most. Oil wealth was acquired through "crime on a scale so grand" -- exactly the kind of unjust original acquisition Locke's theory dismisses -- and it funded the geopolitical threat (bin Laden) that the Lockean framework cannot explain. |

### Paraphrase Test

**Try this:** Restate the argument of this section in 3-4 sentences of your own. Then compare with the summary above -- what did you capture? What did you miss?

Key points to check your paraphrase against:
- Did you capture Locke's *method* -- the esoteric, gradualist strategy of redefining tradition from within?
- Did you capture the philosophical core -- the move from "human nature is knowable" to "human nature is unknowable," and the derivation of liberal rights from that agnosticism?
- Did you capture the relationship between the labor theory of value and the dismissal of boundary cases about original property acquisition?
- Did you capture the turn at the end -- that September 11 and the oil economy represent boundary cases that can no longer be deferred?
- Did you capture the irony that America's gradual secularization was not a betrayal of its founding but a fulfillment of it?

### Open Questions

- Is Thiel's reading of Locke as an esoteric writer historically defensible, or is it an imposition of Strauss's hermeneutic method onto a thinker who may have been more straightforwardly sincere? If Locke was genuinely devout, then America's drift from Christianity really is a drift, not a design -- and conservative moralists may have a point.
- Does the "unknowable X" argument actually work as a foundation for liberal rights, or does it prove too much? Genuine agnosticism about human nature could equally justify authoritarianism or nihilism, not only liberalism.
- How much weight can the oil exception bear? If oil is an anomaly rather than a paradigm, does it really undermine the Lockean framework, or is it simply a hard case that the framework handles imperfectly?
- What does Thiel mean by calling the Enlightenment a "period of intellectual slumber and amnesia"? What truths, specifically, were forgotten -- and can they be recovered without also recovering the violence of the pre-Enlightenment world?
- Is Thiel conflating Locke's philosophical project with America's actual historical development? American history involved many thinkers and traditions beyond Locke (republican virtue theory, Puritan theology, the Civil War, the Progressive Era). Does treating America as "the country founded by Locke" flatten a more complex intellectual history?
- What is the status of the inverted Keynes allusion ("none of this will matter if we are all dead in the short run")? It suggests the problem is one of temporal horizons: Locke's framework may be correct in the long run but fatally inadequate in the short run, which is the only run that matters if existential threats are at stake.

## Section 4: Leo Strauss: Proceed with Caution

### Backgrounder

#### Leo Strauss (1899-1973)

Leo Strauss was a German-Jewish political philosopher who fled Nazi Germany and settled at the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1949 to 1968. His intellectual project was a recovery of classical political philosophy against the crisis of modernity -- the collapse of the West's confidence in reason, natural right, and the possibility of genuine philosophical knowledge. Strauss argued that modern political philosophy, from Machiavelli through Hobbes, Locke, and Nietzsche, had progressively lowered the horizon of human aspiration, culminating in relativism and nihilism. His students have been controversially associated with American neoconservatism.

#### Esoteric vs. Exoteric Writing

Strauss's core hermeneutical method. He argued that from antiquity through the early modern period, serious philosophers wrote on two levels: an **exoteric** surface conforming to prevailing orthodoxies (for the public), and an **esoteric** level "between the lines" conveying heterodox views visible only to "trustworthy and intelligent readers." This was a rational response to the threat of persecution: Socrates was executed, and every subsequent philosopher had reason to remember.

#### Key Works Referenced

- **Persecution and the Art of Writing (1952):** Strauss's methodological work laying out the theory of esoteric writing. Thiel draws on its thought experiment of the historian in a totalitarian country and its famous line about the advantages of esoteric communication.

- **Natural Right and History (1953):** Strauss's most systematic work, attacking modern historicism and value relativism while arguing for the recovery of classical natural right. It directly opposes the Lockean "unknowable X."

#### The Katechon

A theological concept from 2 Thessalonians 2:6-7 -- the mysterious force "that restraineth" the coming of the Antichrist. In medieval political theology, often identified with the Roman Empire or the Church. Schmitt adopted it as a political category: the katechon is whatever order prevents the final dissolution of meaningful political life. Thiel applies it to Strauss's project, which aims to fortify the West by recovering knowledge of the "permanent problems" -- but which paradoxically may hasten the dissolution it seeks to prevent.

#### Founding Violence: Romulus/Remus, Cain/Abel

Both Roman legend and Genesis locate fratricide at the origin of civilization: Romulus kills Remus to found Rome; Cain kills Abel and builds the first city. Strauss draws attention to this convergence as evidence that civilizational origins are inseparable from primal violence -- a truth Locke's account of peaceful property acquisition deliberately obscures.

#### How This Connects

Sections 1-3 established a dilemma with no exit: Locke is too naive, Schmitt too violent. Strauss attempts a middle path -- recovering hard truths about human nature while avoiding Schmitt's openly violent solutions, using esoteric discretion (the "veil" over "sad exigencies"). But Thiel ultimately judges even Strauss's path as self-undermining.

### Summary

Thiel presents Leo Strauss as attempting the central synthesis of the essay: a path between Lockean naivete (which suppresses dangerous truths about human nature) and Schmittian violence (which would destroy the liberal order in the act of defending it). Strauss's key insight is that the great philosophers wrote esoterically -- encoding dangerous but genuine truths "between the lines" for careful readers only -- because certain truths about founding violence, the nature of the city, and the limits of justice in wartime are too destabilizing for open discourse. Against Locke's "unknowable X," Strauss maintains that a permanent truth about human nature exists and can be known, but only through painstaking study, never through systematic summary. However, Thiel argues that the Straussian project is self-undermining: the very act of recovering awareness of the "permanent problems" makes the unreflective defense of liberal democracy impossible. The section concludes by gesturing toward intelligence services and secret action as the practical domain where Straussian insights might be applied, but leaves unresolved whether such a path can sustain the liberal order or will instead accelerate its unraveling.

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition | How the author uses it |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| Esoteric / exoteric writing | Writing on two levels: an exoteric surface conforming to prevailing orthodoxies for the general public, and an esoteric message "between the lines" conveying the author's actual, often heterodox, views to careful readers only. | Thiel presents this as Strauss's fundamental method and his central discovery about the great philosophers. Esoteric writing is the mechanism by which dangerous truths about human nature can be preserved across centuries without provoking the persecution of their authors. Strauss "practices what he preaches," and Thiel is arguably doing the same. |
| The permanent problems | The enduring, irresolvable questions about political life -- the nature of the city, the violence of founding, the relation between religion and the best regime -- that every serious political thinker must confront but that the Enlightenment attempted to suppress. | Thiel uses this to define what Strauss recovers from the classical tradition. Unlike Locke, who treats these questions as unanswerable and dismissible, Strauss insists they are permanently present and dangerous. Their recovery is both the strength and the fatal weakness of the Straussian project: knowing the problems makes unreflective political action impossible. |
| The katechon / "hastener against its will" | The katechon (2 Thessalonians) is the restraining force holding back apocalyptic dissolution. The "hastener" is its opposite: the force that accelerates the end. | Thiel's most devastating judgment on Strauss. The Straussian project intends to fortify the West (be the katechon) but the self-awareness it produces paradoxically disables the capacity for unreflective action that the defense of the city requires. The katechon becomes the hastener "against its will." |
| Founding violence (Romulus/Remus) | The convergence between the Roman founding myth (Romulus murders Remus) and Genesis (Cain murders Abel and builds the first city): both locate fratricide at the origin of civilization. | Strauss uses this to argue that political founding is inseparable from primal violence. Thiel follows Strauss in peeling back the patriotic American narrative: America "owes her greatness not only to her habitual adherence to the principles of freedom and justice, but also to her occasional deviation from them." |
| "Sad exigencies" / the veil | Strauss's phrase for the morally troubling actions that even decent societies must take in wartime, which should be "left covered with the veil with which they are justly covered." | Captures Strauss's middle position: unlike Locke, he acknowledges liberal principles will sometimes be violated out of necessity; unlike Schmitt, he does not celebrate this. The practical question is whether a veil can hold once you have told everyone it is there. |
| The parallel histories (official vs. secret services) | From Roberto Calasso: the post-1945 world narrated in two irreconcilable ways -- the conventional history of states and public institutions, and the hidden history of intelligence services ("murders, traps, betrayals, assassinations, cover-ups"). | Thiel identifies the practical domain where Straussian philosophy finds application. If overt liberal democracy is insufficient, the covert world of intelligence -- "Echelon, the secret coordination of the world's intelligence services" -- is where the real work of maintaining global order takes place. |
| "Universally valid hierarchy of ends" / "no universally valid rules of action" | Strauss's middle position: permanent, knowable moral ends exist, but the specific actions required to pursue them cannot be fixed in advance and must respond to circumstances. | The philosophical foundation for the "sad exigencies" argument: because the right action depends on context, no limits on wartime conduct "can be defined in advance." Thiel does not let this pass without noting its implications for civil liberties and the treatment of "subversive elements within society." |

### Paraphrase Test

**Try this:** Restate the argument of Section 4 in 4-5 sentences of your own. Then compare with the summary above.

Key points to check your paraphrase against:
- Did you capture the impasse Strauss responds to (Locke too naive, Schmitt too violent)?
- Did you get the esoteric/exoteric distinction and why it matters for the argument?
- Did you note the self-undermining paradox -- recovering the permanent problems makes their resolution harder?
- Did you register the practical turn toward intelligence services and secret action?
- Did you catch that Thiel ultimately judges Strauss's path, too, as insufficient?

### Open Questions

- Is Thiel's essay itself esoteric? If Strauss argues dangerous truths must be veiled, and Thiel is writing an essay that unveils Strauss's method of veiling, is the act of publicizing this method an example of the "hastening" Thiel warns about -- or does the essay have its own hidden layer?
- Who decides when the "veil" over "sad exigencies" is lifted? If constitutional checks and balances produce political paralysis, and the practical answer is intelligence services (Echelon), what constrains their judgment?
- Is the American exception real or a deliberate esoteric maneuver? Strauss first presents America as the possible exception to founding violence (via Thomas Paine), then immediately retracts it. Is he genuinely uncertain, or is this designed to undermine the patriotic account for the careful reader?
- Does the katechon paradox mean that no katechon is possible? If so, the essay's logic drives inexorably toward Girard and the apocalyptic conclusion -- is that the intended direction?
- Is the suggestion that Echelon represents "the decisive path to a truly global pax Americana" meant seriously, esoterically, or as a reductio ad absurdum of the Straussian position?
- What does "No new Alexander is in sight" imply? Is this a lament, a warning, or a relief -- and does the closing Spengler quotation (with its invocation of approaching Caesarism) suggest Thiel thinks such a figure might eventually appear?
