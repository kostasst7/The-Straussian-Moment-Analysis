## Carl Schmitt: The Persistence of the Political

---

### Backgrounder

#### Carl Schmitt (1888-1985)

Carl Schmitt was a German jurist, legal theorist, and political philosopher whose work remains among the most controversial and influential in 20th-century political thought. He wrote prolifically during the Weimar Republic and into the Nazi period. In 1933 he joined the Nazi party and served as "Crown Jurist of the Third Reich," providing legal justification for Hitler's emergency powers and the purge of Jewish jurists from the German bar. After the war he was interned by the Allies, interrogated at Nuremberg (though never indicted), and permanently excluded from academic life in Germany. He never publicly recanted or apologized.

Despite this biography -- or in some readings because of it -- Schmitt has exerted enormous influence across the political spectrum. His analysis of sovereignty, emergency powers, and the limits of liberalism has been taken up by the political left (Giorgio Agamben, Chantal Mouffe), the political right (various authoritarian and populist movements), and by scholars who find his diagnostic power indispensable even as they reject his prescriptions. His appeal lies in his willingness to name what liberalism prefers to leave unnamed: that political order ultimately rests on decisions about who belongs and who does not, decisions that cannot be reduced to legal procedure or economic calculation.

#### Key Works

- **The Concept of the Political (1932):** Schmitt's most famous work, in which he argues that the specific criterion of the political is the distinction between friend and enemy. Politics is not defined by any particular subject matter (economics, morality, aesthetics) but by the intensity of association and dissociation -- the point at which a group of people identifies another group as an existential threat. Every other human endeavor (trade, art, debate) can become political the moment it reaches this threshold of intensity.

- **Political Theology (1922):** Opens with the famous declaration: "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception." Schmitt argues that all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts -- sovereignty corresponds to God's omnipotence, the state of exception to the miracle, and so on. Legal order presupposes a normal situation, but who decides whether the situation is normal? That decision, which cannot itself be grounded in law, is the sovereign act.

#### The Friend/Enemy Distinction

This is Schmitt's core idea. The political is not a domain alongside economics, morality, and aesthetics; it is the degree of intensity that transforms any domain into a matter of existential commitment. When a conflict reaches the point at which a group perceives another group as a fundamental threat to its way of life -- not merely as a competitor, a debating opponent, or a commercial rival -- the conflict has become political in Schmitt's sense. The enemy is not personally hated; the enemy is the public other whose existence poses a question that cannot be resolved by negotiation, bribery, or procedural compromise.

Crucially, for Schmitt, you cannot abolish this distinction. You can only pretend it does not exist, and in doing so you leave yourself defenseless against those who still recognize it.

#### Political Theology

Schmitt's concept of political theology operates on two levels. First, structurally: modern political concepts (sovereignty, the state of exception, constitutional order) are secularized versions of theological concepts and carry their logic forward even when their religious content has been emptied out. Second, substantively: Schmitt was a committed Catholic who believed that genuine political seriousness requires a metaphysical horizon. Without the eschatological framework of salvation and damnation, politics degenerates into mere administration -- comfortable, empty, and ultimately indefensible. In Thiel's presentation of Schmitt, this theological dimension is essential: the friend/enemy distinction is not merely a sociological observation but a "pale reflection" of the ultimate division between those who follow Christ and those who do not.

#### Alexandre Kojeve (1902-1968)

Alexandre Kojeve was a Russian-born, Paris-based philosopher who delivered an enormously influential series of lectures on Hegel's *Phenomenology of Spirit* from 1933 to 1939. His central claim was that history, understood as the struggle for recognition between human beings, had effectively ended. The principles of the French Revolution -- liberty, equality, universal recognition -- had triumphed in principle; what remained was merely the working out of their institutional consequences. At the end of history, humanity would have nothing left to fight about. Kojeve took this conclusion to disturbing extremes: post-historical "man" would cease to be human in any meaningful sense, becoming instead an animal of the species *Homo sapiens* engaged in sophisticated but purposeless activity -- art, play, eroticism -- without genuine struggle or risk. Francis Fukuyama later popularized (and softened) this thesis in *The End of History and the Last Man* (1992).

Thiel invokes Kojeve here because Schmitt's nightmare scenario -- a world that has abandoned all hard questions -- is precisely what Kojeve describes as the inevitable destination of history. The two thinkers agree on the diagnosis (depoliticization leads to the disappearance of genuine humanity) but disagree on the evaluation: Kojeve accepts it with ironic resignation, while Schmitt regards it with apocalyptic horror.

#### How This Connects to Sections 1-2

Schmitt is the anti-Locke. Where Section 2 showed Locke's strategy of replacing hard questions about human nature with an unknowable "X" and building a tolerant commercial order on that agnosticism, Section 3 presents the thinker who says that strategy is a fatal self-deception. Locke says: we cannot know the answers to questions about human nature, so let us build a politics that does not require answers. Schmitt says: precisely because we cannot agree on the answers, we will inevitably divide into groups that fight over them -- and the group that pretends otherwise will lose.

Section 1 established that the Enlightenment abandoned questions of human nature after the violence of the Reformation. Section 2 showed how Locke's framework operationalized that abandonment into a functioning political order. Section 3 now asks: what happens when someone refuses to play along? Schmitt's answer is that the political -- the irreducible division of humanity into friends and enemies -- never disappears; it only goes underground, and those who forget this are conquered by those who remember.

This sets up the essay's central dilemma. If Locke is right, the West can survive by expanding its commercial tolerance to encompass all of humanity. If Schmitt is right, that tolerance is a luxury that survives only so long as it is protected by people willing to fight and die for it -- people whom the tolerant order itself cannot produce.

### Summary

Thiel presents Carl Schmitt as the radical alternative to Locke and the Enlightenment: where Locke built a political order by setting aside questions of human nature, Schmitt insists that such questions permanently divide humanity into friends and enemies and that no one can opt out of this division unilaterally. Those who try -- pacifists, depoliticized commercial societies -- do not escape conflict; they merely disarm themselves and, by default, aid the enemy. Applied to the post-9/11 confrontation between the West and Islam, Schmitt's framework captures the "essential strangeness" of the situation: one side treats the struggle as more important than life and death, while the other is confused about what it is fighting for. But Thiel identifies a trap at the heart of Schmitt's logic. If the West re-politicizes and adopts a crusading posture to match its adversary, it destroys the liberal identity that makes the West the West; if it refuses to fight, it will be defeated. The section closes with the alternative possibility that the political itself might vanish entirely -- Kojeve's end of history -- which Schmitt interprets through Christian eschatology as the reign of the Antichrist, a "religion of technicity" in which humanity trades its soul for comfort and entertainment.

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition | How the author uses it |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| The friend/enemy distinction | Schmitt's thesis that the defining criterion of politics is the ability to distinguish between friends (those with whom one shares a common form of life) and enemies (those whose existence poses an existential challenge to that form of life). The distinction is public, not personal; one need not hate the enemy privately. | Thiel uses this as the structural opposite of Locke's tolerant agnosticism. The friend/enemy distinction explains why the West-Islam confrontation cannot be managed through negotiation or economic incentive alone: one side has identified an enemy, and the other refuses to recognize that the category applies. |
| The political | For Schmitt, "the political" is not a sphere of activity (like economics or art) but the degree of intensity at which any human grouping divides into friends and enemies willing to kill and die. It is the existential seriousness underlying all politics. | Thiel frames the entire section around whether "the political" can be permanently escaped or merely suppressed. He argues that Schmitt's "persistence of the political" is the central challenge to liberal modernity: if the political always returns, then Locke's bargain -- peace through depoliticization -- is a temporary reprieve, not a permanent solution. |
| Political theology | Schmitt's thesis that modern political concepts are secularized theological concepts and that genuine political order requires a metaphysical horizon (an account of ultimate meaning). | Thiel shows Schmitt connecting the political and the religious: the friend/enemy distinction is a "pale reflection" of the eschatological choice to follow or reject Christ. This connection explains why Schmitt lists "pacifists" and "cremationists" together -- both reject a decision (political or religious) that Schmitt regards as inescapable. |
| The katechon | In Christian eschatology (from 2 Thessalonians 2:6-7), the katechon is the force that "restrains" or "holds back" the coming of the Antichrist. Schmitt adopted this concept to describe any political order that preserves meaningful human existence by maintaining the friend/enemy distinction and preventing the collapse into depoliticized uniformity. | Though Thiel does not use the term explicitly, the concept operates throughout: the fear that the West will lose the capacity to recognize enemies -- and thereby lose its soul -- is the katechontic anxiety. Schmitt's entire argument is that the political *is* the katechon; if it disappears, the Antichrist (comfortable nihilism) takes over. |
| The Antichrist / religion of technicity | In Schmitt's political-theological framework, the Antichrist is not a demonic figure but a seductive one: he conquers the world by offering "peace and security," making people forget they have souls. The "religion of technicity" is the faith in unlimited technological mastery over nature that replaces genuine religion and genuine politics. | Thiel uses Schmitt's Antichrist as the endpoint of depoliticization: a world of pure comfort, entertainment, and administration -- "The Matrix for those who choose not to take their red pills." This is Schmitt's version of Kojeve's end of history, recast in apocalyptic language. It represents the worst-case scenario for both Schmitt and (implicitly) Thiel: not violent defeat, but the quiet surrender of everything that makes human life meaningful. |
| The Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) | A multilateral treaty in which signatory nations agreed to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. Signed by most of the world's nations, including Germany, Japan, and Italy -- all of which went to war within the following decade. | Thiel (via Schmitt) cites this as the paradigmatic example of liberal self-delusion: a piece of paper that declared war illegal while doing nothing about the friend/enemy distinctions that produce wars. It epitomizes the belief that one can abolish the political by wishing it away. |
| Pyrrhic victory | A victory that comes at such devastating cost to the victor that it is equivalent to defeat. Named after King Pyrrhus of Epirus, who won battles against Rome but suffered irreplaceable losses. | Thiel uses this term to crystallize the dilemma Schmitt's logic creates for the West: even if the West could revive the crusading faith of Cromwell or Pope Urban II and thereby match Islam's political-religious intensity, this would destroy the liberal, tolerant character that defines the modern West. The victory over the external enemy would come at the price of becoming the enemy. |
| Unilateral disarmament (political sense) | The decision by one side in a conflict to renounce the use of force or abandon the friend/enemy distinction, regardless of what the other side does. In Schmitt's framework, this does not produce peace but rather ensures defeat. | Thiel extends the concept beyond the military domain. The West's refusal to recognize Islam as a political enemy is a form of unilateral disarmament: "if a part of the population declares that it no longer recognizes enemies, then, depending on the circumstance, it joins their side and aids them." The concept links to the broader Schmittian argument that neutrality is impossible in genuinely political conflicts. |

### Paraphrase Test

**Try this:** Restate the argument of this section in 3-4 sentences of your own. Then compare with the summary above -- what did you capture? What did you miss?

Things to watch for when comparing:

- Did you capture the *dilemma* (fight and lose your identity, or refuse to fight and lose the war), not just the description of Schmitt's position?
- Did you note that Thiel does not simply endorse Schmitt? The section presents Schmitt's framework as diagnostically powerful but prescriptively trapped -- a double bind, not a solution.
- Did you register the theological dimension? The connection between Schmitt's friend/enemy distinction and his eschatology (the Antichrist, the religion of technicity) is not decoration; it is the structural reason Schmitt believes depoliticization is not merely imprudent but spiritually catastrophic.
- Did you catch the Kojeve coda? The section does not end with the dilemma but with a third possibility -- the total disappearance of the political -- which Schmitt regards as worse than defeat. This ending pivots toward the essay's deeper question: is there a position that avoids both horns of Schmitt's dilemma?

### Open Questions

- **Is Schmitt's dilemma real or a false binary?** Thiel presents the West as caught between fighting (and becoming like its enemy) and not fighting (and losing). But is this actually exhaustive? Could there be forms of political seriousness that do not require adopting the enemy's worldview -- a way to recognize the friend/enemy distinction without embracing crusade?

- **What does "becoming like your enemy" actually mean?** Thiel writes that "one must choose one's enemies well, for one will soon be just like them." How literally should we take this? Does any war against a theocratic enemy require becoming theocratic, or is the claim more limited -- that sustained existential conflict reshapes the combatant's identity in the direction of the adversary? What historical evidence supports or undermines this?

- **Does Schmitt's framework apply to asymmetric conflict?** Schmitt's friend/enemy distinction was developed in the context of European state-on-state warfare. Does it usefully describe a conflict between a state system and a non-state network (al-Qaeda) motivated by a universalist religion? The attackers of 9/11 were not a "state" recognizing another state as an enemy; they were individuals acting within a transnational religious movement. Does this stretch or break Schmitt's categories?

- **Is the "end of the political" really the Antichrist, or might it be salvation?** Schmitt and Kojeve agree that depoliticization means the end of genuine humanity, but why should we accept this? One could argue that a world without existential enemies -- a world of "culture, civilization, economics, morality, law, art, entertainment" -- is precisely the good life that politics was always supposed to secure. Is Schmitt's horror at this prospect a substantive insight or a temperamental preference for intensity?

- **How does Thiel himself evaluate Schmitt?** The section presents Schmitt's diagnosis sympathetically (it "captures the essential strangeness of the unfolding confrontation") but identifies his prescription as trapped. Thiel seems to regard Schmitt as a necessary corrective to liberal complacency but not as a viable alternative. What does this tell us about where the essay is heading -- toward Strauss and Girard? What would a position that takes Schmitt's diagnosis seriously without accepting his conclusions look like?

- **What is the relationship between Schmitt's "religion of technicity" and Thiel's own career in technology?** Thiel is a technology entrepreneur who co-founded PayPal and was an early investor in Facebook -- enterprises that arguably contribute to exactly the world of comfort and entertainment that Schmitt identifies with the Antichrist. Is Thiel aware of this tension? Does it inform the essay's refusal to fully endorse any of the four thinkers it examines?
